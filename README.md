# Solving linear systems of equations using Crout and Doolittle matrix decomposition algorithms

This project is a Machine Learning model to predict real estate prices of properties across France. It is a supervised regression task. The model used for this project is XGBoost.

## Dataset

The dataset contains the data of 350+ real-estate properties across France. The features are:

* the city where the property is located (Aix-En-Provence, Vincennes, Toulouse, Paris, Marseille, Manosque, Lyon, Issy-Les-Moulineaux, Gif Sur Yvette, Enghien Les Bains or Bourg La Reine)

* the region (Paca, Ile de France or Sud Ouest)

* the type (F1, F2, F3, F4, F5, F6, F7)

* the area in square metres 

* the rent per year in €  

* the price of the property in €

## Features importance

For this dataset, the two most dominant features are clearly the annual rent and the area of the property, which is expected for a regression model on real estate prices. The other features help to fine-tune the accuracy of the model.
